# Livewell

The wellness productivity app for action-oriented athletes.

## About

Livewell is wellness productivity app for organizing your daily goals using the five core tenets of wellness: Mobility, Strength, Movement, Nutrition, and Hygiene.

Living well is a daily practice you carry out for life, and a one-size-fits-all approach is generally not very effective. Everyone's wellness picture will look a little bit different. That is why Livewell is not prescriptive. With Livewell, you are in control of setting your goals in each of the five wellness areas to create a custom-tailored wellness plan that fits your lifestyle. This gives you the power and flexibility to achieve your goals on your time and on your terms.

## Purpose

The first step in Livewell is defining your purpose. Your purpose will drive all of your decision making regarding your wellness. Wondering if you should do a few extra sets in your workout? Filtering that decision through your purpose will make it easier to stay on track with your goals. For example, if you don't want to be too sore to play with your kids, you may want to take it easier that day. Being mindful of your purpose will put things into perspective and give context to the goals you set using the five core tenets of wellness. Your purpose is your "why" and the five core tenets are your "how". In this section, you will also be defining the "what". In other words, what you will need to achieve your goals.

### Why

This is where you will define your purpose. Your purpose will drive your decision making when working towards your goals. This could be as simple as "be able to play with my kids more" or "spend more time being active with my partner". Your purpose should be short and sweet (limited to 280 characters). Keep it simple and personal, and make it something that will inspire you to reach your goals each and every day.

### How

You will be working towards your goals using the five core tenets of wellness. This section explains those tenets and how to use them to achieve success.

### What

This is where you will define what you need in order to achieve your goals. This could be as simple as equipment you need such as a jump rope or a yoga mat. Defining a small, simple list of what you need to be successful will set you on the right path to achieve your goals.

## Overview

Once you have defined your purpose, you will be exploring the five core tenets of wellness: Mobility, Strength, Movement, Nutrition, and Hygiene.

### Goals

In each of the five areas of Livewell, you will find a **Goals** tab. The **Goals** tab allows you to define your goals in each area. Your goals could be daily, weekly, monthly; the power is in your hands to determine what is best for you at any given time during your wellness journey. Remember to make your goals simple, specific, and attainable. For example, a goal for mobility could be to address knee pain by doing some soft-tissue work. A goal for nutrition could be to remember to hydrate first thing in the morning. Giving yourself small attainable goals to achieve each day or each week will help you live your purpose and improve your overall wellness.

### Learnings

Livewell is about self-discovery. That is why each section will have a **Learnings** tab. The **Learnings** tab allows you to take notes about things you've learned about yourself in each area during your wellness journey. This will help you make improvements and adjustments along the way, help you identify your preferences, and help to determine what motivates you and gets you closer to achieving your goals.

### Trusted Resources

Each section will also have a **Trusted Resources** tab. The **Trusted Resources** tab is an area where you can list any important influences you have such as coaches, authors, athletes, etc. A trusted resource is an influence that has stood the test of time in your wellness journey. It is important to limit your trusted resources to only those which have helped you to achieve your goals. Remember, there is a lot of bad information out there, so be picky and keep this list short with maybe one to three trusted resources with whom you align and from whom you feel comfortable getting advice. If you're on the fence about a trusted resource, it is best not to add them here, but you can always filter that decision through your purpose by asking, "Is this influence getting me closer to achieving my goals?"

## The Five Core Tenets of Wellness

There are five core tenets of wellness which correspond to the five areas within Livewell. These tenets are the puzzle pieces which make up your overall wellness picture.

1. **Mobility** - The freedom to move
2. **Strength** - The capacity to move
2. **Movement** - The application of strength and mobility
3. **Nutrition** - Fuel for your body
4. **Hygiene** - Illness prevention and self-care

Livewell allows you to explore each of these five areas by creating goals and tracking your learning along the way.

Mobility, Strength, and Movement share some common tabs, so let's discuss those now.

### Exercises

The **Exercises** tab is where you will add any exercises you would like to perform. For Mobility, this could be the name of a particular stretch like "Couch Stretch". For Strength, this could be the name of an exercise like "Push-ups". For Movement, this could be the name of a move from your movement practice such as "Guard Escape" for Jiu Jitsu, "Child's Pose" for Yoga, etc. You can rate yourself on an exercise based on the quality at which you perform it. This will help you know when you are ready to progress to a more difficult exercise variation. You can also take notes about the exercise such as how you felt when performing it, what you want to get better at, or cues to improve your form.

### Workouts

The **Workouts** tab is where you will combine individual exercises into a workout. Exercises in a workout can be for time or for reps. You can reorder the exercises in a workout however you'd like.

### Daily Workout

The **Daily Workout** tab is where you will queue up a daily workout to perform. Once a workout has been queued up, you can press "start" to begin the workout. When a workout has been started, you will see the exercise to perform along with the time or number of reps. An exercise can be skipped or restarted. You can complete an exercise and go to the next one by clicking the "next" button at the bottom. Click the dropdown to see a list of all the exercises in the daily workout. There you can see whether or not an exercise has been completed, or click on an exercise to perform it. You can also complete the entire workout from this menu. Once a workout has been completed, you can chose the next workout to queue up.
